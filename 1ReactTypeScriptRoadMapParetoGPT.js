/**

here’s a focused 20% roadmap for learning React with TypeScript, based on the Pareto principle:

1. Set Up and Basics (25%)
Project Setup: Use create-react-app with TypeScript (npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript) or Vite.
JSX with TypeScript: Understand the slight syntax differences, like how to annotate component props, state, and events.

Types and Interfaces: Learn to define props using type or interface—this will help you create reusable, type-safe components.

2. Props and State Management (25%)
Typing Props and State: Practice typing simple props,

and states in functional components.

Component Composition: Learn how to use props to compose multiple components and ensure they work seamlessly together with type checking.

Remember. If you can be without state management library, then do not use it. Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VenLRGHx3D4
to explain

State Management Libraries (Intro to Zustand or Redux): Get familiar with typing Redux actions and reducers if you’re using Redux.
 Zustand can be easier to get started with, as it’s lighter and requires fewer initial setup steps.

(good article)


3. Hooks with TypeScript (30%)
useState, useEffect, and useContext: Learn to type useState with different data types (e.g., objects, arrays), handle effects correctly, and use context with TypeScript.
Custom Hooks: Try writing simple custom hooks, typing them so they’re reusable across components.

4. Common Advanced Patterns (20%)
Generics in Components and Hooks: Understand how to use generics in component props and custom hooks for flexibility and reuse.
Type-Safe Refs (useRef): Learn the correct way to type useRef for DOM elements or other references.
Error Handling: Get familiar with type-safe error handling, such as setting up error boundaries or handling specific errors in your components.
By focusing on these 20% of topics, you’ll cover a substantial portion of React and TypeScript concepts that will handle most use cases.
 This foundational knowledge will also make it much easier to learn and apply advanced topics when needed.
